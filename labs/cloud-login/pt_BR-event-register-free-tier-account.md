# Get Started

## Introduction

First of all, you'll need an Oracle Cloud account. This five-minute lab will guide you through the steps so you can get an account in Oracle Cloud Free Mode and how to join it.

### Existing Cloud Accounts

If you already have access to an Oracle Cloud account, including an Oracle Cloud account that uses [Oracle Universal Credits](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/csgsg/universal-credits.html), proceed to **PASSO 2** to sign in to your Cloud Tenancy.

### Two Cloud-On-One Offerings

Oracle Cloud Free Mode allows you to sign up for an Oracle Cloud account that provides a number of Always Free services and a Free Trial with $300 in free credit for use across all eligible Oracle Cloud services for up to 30 days. Always Free services are available indefinitely. Free Trial services can be used until your $300 in free credits are consumed or 30 days expire, whichever comes first.

### What you'll need

*   A valid email address
*   Possibility to receive an SMS verification text (only if your email is not recognized)
